Digital Menu - Manager Functional Test Script

Audience: Non-technical manager. Goal: Validate that the Digital Menu works for day-to-day use.

1) Preparation
- Confirm the web app URL (Frontend): e.g., http://localhost:4200 (or your deployed URL)
- Confirm the menu API is available (Backend): e.g., http://localhost:8000/api
- Test account: username admin, password evolusys

2) Success criteria (high-level)
- You can sign in and out
- You can configure company settings, colors, currencies, and see them reflected on the public menu
- You can manage categories, ingredients, and products, including images
- Public Digital Menu loads without sign-in and shows the right data and theme

3) Sign in and out
Steps
1. Open the app URL
2. Click Login in the header
3. Enter admin / evolusys and submit
Expected
- You land on Products page and see a welcome toast
- The header shows Products and Settings links
4. Click Logout
Expected
- You return to the Login page and Products/Settings links disappear

4) Settings (branding, currencies, rate)
Steps
1. Sign in and go to Settings
2. Set Company Name (e.g., "Evolusys Bistro")
3. Set Currency 1 (e.g., USD) and Currency 2 (e.g., EUR)
4. Set Rate (e.g., 0.9) - this drives automatic price conversion into Currency 2
5. Pick Primary Color and Background Color
6. Click Save
7. Upload a Logo image and a Barcode image
Expected
- After Save, a success message appears
- Logo and barcode images display in the Settings page previews
- Opening the public Digital Menu shows: company name, currencies, colors applied, and barcode image in the header

5) Categories
Steps
1. Go to Products page (signed in)
2. In the Categories panel, enter a new category name (e.g., "Pasta") and click Add
3. Select that category row, click Edit, change name (e.g., "Fresh Pasta"), click Update
4. With the category selected for editing, upload an image
5. Create a second category (e.g., "Desserts")
Expected
- New categories appear in the list
- Updated name is reflected immediately
- Category image appears as a small thumbnail
- On the public Digital Menu, category chips include the new categories
Business rule
- A category with linked products cannot be deleted (you will see an error if you try)

6) Ingredients
Steps
1. In the Ingredients panel, add a new ingredient (e.g., "Truffle")
2. Edit its name (e.g., "Black Truffle") and update
3. With the ingredient selected, upload an image
4. Add more ingredients (e.g., "Parmesan", "Egg Yolks")
Expected
- Ingredients are listed and images visible when uploaded
Business rule
- Ingredient names must be unique

7) Products
Steps (create)
1. In the Product Editor, enter Name (e.g., "Tagliatelle al Tartufo")
2. Enter Price (Currency 1), e.g., 50
3. Choose one or more categories (e.g., Fresh Pasta)
4. Choose one or more ingredients (e.g., Black Truffle, Parmesan)
5. Click Add Product
6. After it appears in the Products table, click Edit, then upload a product image
Expected
- Product appears in the list with the name, price in Currency 1 and Currency 2 (auto-computed by Rate), category and ingredient badges, and image once uploaded
Steps (update)
7. Click Edit on the product, change price or categories/ingredients, click Update Product
Expected
- Price in Currency 2 recalculates using the current Rate
Steps (delete)
8. Click Delete, confirm
Expected
- Product is removed from the list

8) Public Digital Menu (no sign-in)
Steps
1. Log out or use a private window
2. Visit the Digital Menu page (Menu link or direct /digital_menu)
3. Use the category chips (All, Fresh Pasta, Desserts, etc.) to filter
Expected
- The page loads without sign-in
- Header shows your logo, company name, currencies, and barcode image
- Theme applies (Primary Color and Background Color)
- Each category section lists its products; each product shows name, both prices, and ingredient names
- Filtering by a category shows only that category's products

9) Persistence and refresh
Steps
1. Make any change (e.g., edit Settings or add a Category)
2. Refresh the page (Ctrl/Cmd+R)
Expected
- Changes persist after refresh

10) Business edge cases to spot-check
- Very long names (category, ingredient, product) display reasonably and do not break the layout
- Special characters in names are accepted and shown correctly
- Price at 0.00 is allowed if your policy permits; negative prices should not be used
- Large image files still upload and show; if too large, the layout should degrade gracefully
- A category with products cannot be deleted (error message appears); ingredients can be deleted unless linked to a product

11) Security expectations (light check)
- Products and Settings pages are only accessible when signed in (you are redirected to Login otherwise)
- The public Digital Menu is accessible without sign-in

12) Pass/Fail checklist (quick summary)
- Login/Logout works
- Settings: name/currencies/rate/colors saved and reflected on the public menu
- Logo and barcode images upload and display; appear on the public menu
- Category CRUD works; cannot delete a category if linked to products
- Ingredient CRUD works; unique names; images display
- Product CRUD works; images display; Currency 2 price updates when Rate changes
- Public Digital Menu loads without sign-in; filtering works; data and theme are correct

Notes
- If something does not behave as expected, note the step number, what you did, what you saw, and what you expected to see.
